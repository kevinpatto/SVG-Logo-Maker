# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

This application quickly creates a simple logo as a svg file. It was made to explore Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance. Users can quickly generate a logo, perhaps as a placeholder. I learned much about OOP-based thought processes.

## Installation

Use `npm i` to install all required modules

## Usage
Run `node index.js` in a node environment. Enter answers to the inquirer questions, then check your examples folder for your completed svg file.
